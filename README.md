# -Automated-Deadlock-Detection-Tool
This project detects deadlocks in operating systems by analyzing process interactions and resource allocations. It uses algorithms like Banker's Algorithm or Wait-For Graph Detection to identify circular waits, providing real-time visualization and resolution suggestions to enhance system reliability.
